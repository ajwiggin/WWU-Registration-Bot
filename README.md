# wwuregbot
Registration bot for Western Washington University.
Command line app for "quick and easy" registration. 
Maybe you can finally get the classes you need.

# To do:
- Create GUI for application, for easier use. (DONE 11/29/18)
- Add support for more CRNs (currently only 3 work) (DONE 11/29/18)
- Send a text notification for success or failure when signing up (with info)
- Set up a refresh delay when registration isn't permitted, and when it is program starts and functions.
- Compile program as an .exe file
